This project aims to parse Latin words. It relies on many of the tools from the Classical Language Toolkit.

Goal: process a text through cltk's lemmatizer and identify the word form

Steps: 

1. python module that writes a csv file of unique lemmata, minus proper names
2. by hand identify stems/roots/parts of speech of the lemmata
3. write rules/classes for the stems/roots/parts of speech
